Enable your students to easily view their progress and pick up where they left off in a course.

== Description ==

It can be easy for students to lose track of their progress in a course that contains many lessons. It can be especially problematic if they’re taking the course over a period of several weeks or months.

Sensei LMS Course Progress provides a widget that displays the lessons in the current course or module. It lets your students see, at a glance, which lessons they have completed and which lessons they still have to take.
